According to the column “Woman’s Realm” of The Daily Record (6 October 1898), the most stylish Victorian women looked to the botanical world for inspiration; one of the season’s most in-demand items was a “noted jeweler’s” finely wrought gold diadem composed of “maidenhair fern leaves.” Not simply a faddish fashion, the maidenhair as an object of feminine decoration extends well past the boundaries of the nineteenth century. Linking Victorian women to medical botanical customs dating back to antiquity, the ferny crown encasing a towering pile of feathery ringlets nods to the longstanding cultural history of the maidenhair fern as an agent of hair restoration. Recently, the Victorian maidenhair’s wrought gold found new life as filigree stitching: to celebrate King Charles III’s 2023 coronation, Queen Consort Camilla donned a [bespoke purple velvet robe ](https://www.royal.uk/news-and-activity/2023-04-29/a-first-glimpse-at-their-majesties-coronation-robes) embroidered with insects and plants including the maidenhair, which is a favorite of Charles and a symbol of purity.

The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above.  The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is `Q1075023`.  When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.

An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates.  In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates `27.5,84.333`, resulting in an identical map.

Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer.  Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.
