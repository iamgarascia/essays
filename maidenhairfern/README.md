According to the column “Woman’s Realm” of The Daily Record (6 October 1898), the most stylish Victorian women looked to the botanical world for inspiration; one of the season’s most in-demand items was a “noted jeweler’s” finely wrought gold diadem composed of “maidenhair fern leaves.” Not simply a faddish fashion, the maidenhair as an object of feminine decoration extends well past the boundaries of the nineteenth century. 
Linking Victorian women to medical botanical customs dating back to antiquity, the ferny crown encasing a towering pile of feathery ringlets nods to the longstanding cultural history of the maidenhair fern as an agent of hair restoration. Recently, the Victorian maidenhair’s wrought gold found new life as filigree stitching: to celebrate King Charles III’s 2023 coronation, Queen Consort Camilla donned a [bespoke purple velvet robe ](https://www.royal.uk/news-and-activity/2023-04-29/a-first-glimpse-at-their-majesties-coronation-robes) embroidered with insects and plants including the maidenhair, which is a favorite of Charles' and a symbol of purity.

Nineteenth-century Welsh botanist-photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn’s photographic tribute to his daughter and collaborator, Thereza, features a young woman peering into a microscope encircled by an ectoplasmic wreath of ferns created by impressing actual fronds onto photosensitive paper. With the maidenhair circlet framing a vignette of intellectual labor, the photograph demonstrates how plants, as decorative and scientific objects, contribute to a visual poetics of Victorian womanhood.

When read alongside one another, the news items and photograph reveal how plants, and in particular the [Adiantum capillus-veneris](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:325030-2), (the true maidenhair), provided a vital narrative register for articulating different expressions of femininity, ranging from the fashion maven to the scientific practitioner. As a [cosmopolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_distribution) species, the maidenhair grows abundantly across the world and its textual and visual counterparts have been just as prolific. While depictions of the plant have circulated for various medicinal, imperialist, scientific, and artistic purposes, this plant narrative tells the story of the maidenhair fern as the story of women’s expression and embodiment by exploring how the plant has historically contributed to cultural narratives of womanhood and femininity. To map out the longstanding relationship between the maidenhair and femininity, I identify key moments in the fern’s [entextualization](https://escholarship.org/content/qt02b8p8jh/qt02b8p8jh_noSplash_858e31711da53bed379afe05bdd7b70b.pdf?t=nukqzr#:~:text=Entextualization%2C%20or%20the%20process%20by,process%20of%20power%20and%20authority.), the processes whereby plants are transformed into linguistic or visual specimens, that provide insight into how maidenhair makes—and remakes— the woman. Tracing the history of the maidenhair and its alliances to different modes of femininity asks us to shift our orientation towards plants to recognize the plant-human relations that shape us.
